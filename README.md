This is a simple to do list app.
It's built with Express and uses MongoDB to store data.
The app is deployed at https://lit-gorge-98053.herokuapp.com/
The main to-do list is displayed on the front page. The main list cannot be empty, and if all items are deleted from the list, default items are re-created.
Additional lists can be created by accessing URLs that correspond to their names, e.g. https://lit-gorge-98053.herokuapp.com/Your_list_name
